  abstract = {Human population is being affected immensely day by day by different epidemic diseases. The West Nile virus outbreaks are epidemic in mainly suburban and urban areas. This paper is a study on various models that can be used to predict the occurrence of an epidemic disease caused by the West Nile Virus (WNV). It is also possible to separate an individual into different compartments like Susceptible and Infectious depending upon the state of infection spread. This paper also discusses different compartmental models that can be used to determine spreading of the West Nile virus. This can be an aid to the health care systems to prevent such deadly viruses to an extent.},

  abstract = {The adverse effect of air pollution has always been a problem for human health. The presence of a high level of air pollutants can cause severe illnesses such as emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma. Air quality prediction helps us to undertake practical action plans for controlling air pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reflects the degree of concentration of pollutants in a locality. The average AQI was calculated for the various cities in China to understand the annual trends. Furthermore, the air quality index has been predicted for ten major cities across China using five different deep learning techniques, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Convolutional Neural Network BiLSTM (CNN-BiLSTM), and Convolutional BiLSTM (Conv1D-BiLSTM). The performance of these models has been compared with a machine learning model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to discover the most efficient deep learning model. The results suggest that the machine learning model, XGBoost, outperforms the deep learning models. While Conv1D-BiLSTM and CNN-BiLSTM perform well among the deep learning models in the estimation of the air quality index (AQI), RNN and Bi-GRU are the least performing ones. Thus, both XGBoost and neural network models are capable of capturing the non-linearity present in the dataset with reliable accuracy.},

  abstract = {Air pollution forecasting offers crucial support for pollution control and regulation. However, the non-linearity, volatility, and complexity of air pollution data pose significant challenges to accurate prediction. To address these challenges, this study develops a multi-variate combined forecasting framework based on feature selection methods, linear and nonlinear forecasting models, and intelligent optimization algorithms. Firstly, the framework analyzes the impact of each subset after feature selection on model performance. Secondly, multiple benchmark models based on different feature subsets and various prediction models are constructed as comparison models to further test the performance of the proposed prediction framework. Finally, two real-world datasets, statistical hypothesis testing, and several evaluation metrics are used to validate the prediction performance of the proposed framework. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the proposed model on the Site 1 dataset is 1.9762, representing an improvement of approximately 4\,\% compared to the best-performing benchmark model. Statistical testing further confirms that the proposed model significantly outperforms the benchmark model. The proposed combined multi-variate forecasting framework provides a heuristic framework for building combined prediction models with high prediction accuracy and robustness.},

Therefore, we investigated the season-varying association between ozone and daily mortality rate in 21 cities of East Asia from 1979 to 2010. Time-series Poisson regression models were used to analyze the association between ozone and daily nonaccidental mortality rate in each city, testing for different temperature lags. The best-fitting model was obtained after adjustment for temperature in the previous 2 weeks. Bayesian hierarchical models were applied to pool the city-specific estimates. An interquartile-range increase of the moving average concentrations of same-day and previous-day ozone was associated with an increase of 1.44\% (95\% posterior interval (PI): 1.08\%, 1.80\%) in daily total mortality rate after adjustment for temperature in the previous 2 weeks. The corresponding increases were 0.62\% (95\% PI: 0.08\%, 1.16\%) in winter, 1.46\% (95\% PI: 0.89\%, 2.03\%) in spring, 1.60\% (95\% PI: 1.03\%, 2.17\%) in summer, and 1.12\% (95\% PI: 0.73\%, 1.51\%) in fall.

  abstract = {Purpose Air pollution epidemiology traditionally focuses on the relationship between individual air pollutants and health outcomes (e.g., mortality). To account for potential copollutant confounding, individual pollutant associations are often estimated by adjusting or controlling for other pollutants in the mixture. Recently, the need to characterize the relationship between health outcomes and the larger multipollutant mixture has been emphasized in an attempt to better protect public health and inform more sustainable air quality management decisions. Methods New and innovative statistical methods to examine multipollutant exposures were identified through a broad literature search, with a specific focus on those statistical approaches currently used in epidemiologic studies of short-term exposures to criteria air pollutants (i.e., particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone). Results Five broad classes of statistical approaches were identified for examining associations between short-term multipollutant exposures and health outcomes, specifically additive main effects, effect measure modification, unsupervised dimension reduction, supervised dimension reduction, and nonparametric methods. These approaches are characterized including advantages and limitations in different epidemiologic scenarios. Discussion By highlighting the characteristics of various studies in which multipollutant statistical methods have been used, this review provides epidemiologists and biostatisticians with a resource to aid in the selection of the most optimal statistical method to use when examining multipollutant exposures.},

  abstract = {We are witnessing the dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic which, unfortunately, go beyond the impact on the health system. Until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines, the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines, perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility. Governments only apply these measures for a reduced period, since they involve the closure of economic activities such as tourism, cultural activities, or nightlife. The main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections. However, the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behavior, among others, make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term. This article evaluates different models for the early prediction of the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic to create a decision support system for policy-makers. We consider a wide branch of models including artificial neural networks such as LSTM and GRU and statistically based models such as autoregressive (AR) or ARIMA. Moreover, several consensus strategies to ensemble all models into one system are proposed to obtain better results in this uncertain environment. Finally, a multivariate model that includes mobility data provided by Google is proposed to better forecast trend changes in the 14-day CI. A real case study in Spain is evaluated, providing very accurate results for the prediction of 14-day CI in scenarios with and without trend changes, reaching 0.93 \$\$R{\textasciicircum}2\$\$, 4.16 RMSE and 1.08 MAE.},

Therefore, air pollution data in Dezhou City in China are collected from January 2014 to December 2023, and multiple deep learning models are used to forecast air pollution PM2.5 concentrations. The ability of the multiple models is evaluated and compared with observed data using various statistical parameters. Although all eight deep learning models can accomplish PM2.5 forecasting assignments, the precision accuracy of the CNN-GRU-LSTM forecasting method is 34.28\% higher than that of the ANN forecasting method. The result shows that CNN-GRU-LSTM has the best forecasting performance compared to the other seven models, achieving an R (correlation coefficient) of 0.9686 and an RMSE (root mean square error) of 4.6491 {$\mu$}g/m3. The RMSE values of CNN, GRU and LSTM models are 57.00\%, 35.98\% and 32.78\% higher than that of the CNN-GRU-LSTM method, respectively. The forecasting results reveal that the CNN-GRU-LSTM predictor remarkably improves the performances of benchmark CNN, GRU and LSTM models in overall forecasting.

  abstract = {Background Exposure to ambient ozone pollution causes health loss and even death, and both are the main risk factors for the disease burden worldwide. We comprehensively evaluated the ozone pollution-related disease burden. Methods First, numbers and age-standardized rates of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were assessed globally and by sub-types in 2019. Furthermore, the temporal trend of the disease burden was explored by the linear regression model from 1990 to 2019. The cluster analysis was used to evaluate the changing pattern of related disease burden across Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) regions. Finally, the age-period-cohort (APC) model and the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model were used to predict the future disease burden in the next 25~years. Result Exposure to ozone pollution contributed to 365,222 deaths and 6,210,145 DALYs globally in 2019, which accounted for 0.65 \% of deaths globally and 0.24 \% of DALYs globally. The disease burden was consistently increasing with age. Males were high-risk populations and low-middle socio-demographic index (SDI) regions were high-risk areas. The disease burden of ozone pollution varied considerably across the GBD regions and the countries. In 2019, the number of deaths and DALYs cases increased by 76.11 \% and 56.37 \%, respectively compared to those in 1990. The predicted results showed that the number of deaths cases and DALYs cases for both genders would still increase from 2020 to 2044. Conclusion In conclusion, ambient ozone pollution has threatened public health globally. More proactive and effective strategic measures should be developed after considering global-specific circumstances.},

This has the advantage that selection bias and confounding due to between-group differences are limited. However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study. A prudent approach to the design, analysis and interpretation of controlled interrupted time series studies is required to ensure that valid information on the effectiveness of health interventions can be ascertained.},

This issue is particularly relevant for Bishkek, a city significantly affected by air pollution. This work addresses the task of forecasting AQI as a classification problem and develops a classifier based on an LSTM neural network for its solution. The classification was based on meteorological parameters corresponding to AQI values measured every 3 h, which serve as the input variables for the neural network. Additionally, the daily amount of coal burned at the thermal power plant in Bishkek, a major pollution source, was used as an extra input variable. The developed classifier can predict AQI as one of four possible classes: AQI {$\leq$} 50 (``Good''), 50 {$<$} AQI {$\leq$} 100 (``Moderate''), 100 {$<$} AQI {$\leq$} 150 (``Unhealthy for sensitive groups''), and AQI {$>$} 150 (``Unhealthy'', ``Very Unhealthy'', ``Hazardous''). Computational experiments were conducted, varying the depth of AQI forecasting (up to 2 days ahead) and the length of input variable sequences (up to 4 days of data history) due to the inertia of air pollution processes. Incorporating the pollution factor as an additional input increased the accuracy of AQI class prediction to 83\%. Further expansion of the observational history will enable the creation of a classifier for predicting AQI classes for AQI {$>$} 200. \#CSOC1120.},

Objectives: We obtained maximum likelihood estimates of the common national effects of the criteria pollutants on mortality based on time-series data from {$\leq$} 108 metropolitan areas in the United States. Methods: We used a subsampling bootstrap procedure to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates and confidence bounds for common national effects of the criteria pollutants, as measured by the percentage increase in daily mortality associated with a unit increase in daily 24-hr mean pollutant concentration on the previous day, while controlling for weather and temporal trends. We considered five pollutants [PM10, ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2)] in single- and multipollutant analyses. Flexible ambient concentration--response models for the pollutant effects were considered as well. We performed limited sensitivity analyses with different degrees of freedom for time trends. Results: In single-pollutant models, we observed significant associations of daily deaths with all pollutants. The O3 coefficient was highly sensitive to the degree of smoothing of time trends. Among the gases, SO2 and NO2 were most strongly associated with mortality. The flexible ambient concentration--response curve for O3 showed evidence of nonlinearity and a threshold at about 30 ppb. Conclusions: Differences between the results of our analyses and those reported from using the Bayesian approach suggest that estimates of the quantitative impact of pollutants depend on the choice of statistical approach, although results are not directly comparable because they are based on different data. In addition, the estimate of the O3-mortality coefficient depends on the amount of smoothing of time trends.},

The impact of ozone on RES mortality declines after COVID-19. Healthcare service provision also reduces the distributional impact of ozone across the elderly and younger groups.

  abstract = {Deep learning models have become increasingly popular for flood prediction due to their superior accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods. However, current models often rely on separate spatial or temporal feature analysis and have limitations on the types, numbers, and dimensions of input data. This study proposes a novel framework to combine the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) by connecting the output of RNN to the deepest part of CNN (i.e., the layer with the richest features). The innovative spatiotemporal feature fusion method is developed to strategically integrate the temporal (e.g., rainfall and flood series) and spatial driving factors (e.g., DEM, imperviousness, drainage network, and their related features). The framework focuses on three critical problems: the identification of key driving factors, the design of hybrid deep learning models, and problem formulation and associated optimization algorithms. We verified the framework through a case study in North China. Bayesian optimization was first applied to identify the seven most influential factors and determine their best combination strategy as the model inputs. Then, the optimal hybrid model LSTM-DeepLabv3+ was identified from 12 model combinations and achieved high prediction accuracies in terms of Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, and Kling-Gupta Efficiency of 0.0071, 0.0253, 0.9730, and 0.7549 under various rainfall conditions. This study demonstrates that the new framework provides effective hybrid models with significantly improved computational efficiency (about 1/125 of the traditional process-based computation time) and offers a promising solution for real-time urban flood prediction.},

Results from long-term epidemiological studies on O3 are scarce and inconclusive. Objectives: In this study, we examined associations between chronic ambient O3 exposure and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large cohort of U.S. adults. Methods: Cancer Prevention Study II participants were enrolled in 1982. A total of 669,046 participants were analyzed, among whom 237,201 deaths occurred through 2004. We obtained estimates of O3 concentrations at the participant's residence from a hierarchical Bayesian space--time model. Estimates of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up to 2.5 {$\mu$}m [PM2.5]) and NO2 concentrations were obtained from land use regression. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine mortality associations adjusted for individual- and ecological-level covariates. Measurements and Main Results: In single-pollutant models, we observed significant positive associations between O3, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In two-pollutant models adjusted for PM2.5, significant positive associations remained between O3 and all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 ppb, 1.02; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.01--1.04), circulatory (HR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 1.01--1.05), and respiratory mortality (HR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.08--1.16) that were unchanged with further adjustment for NO2. We also observed positive mortality associations with both PM2.5 (both near source and regional) and NO2 in multipollutant models. Conclusions: Findings derived from this large-scale prospective study suggest that long-term ambient O3 contributes to risk of respiratory and circulatory mortality. Substantial health and environmental benefits may be achieved by implementing further measures aimed at controlling O3 concentrations.},

Here we evaluate premature deaths attributable to long-term exposure to ambient ozone in China between 2013 and 2017 with an air quality model at 5~km resolution and the latest estimates of the relative risk to health. We use a modified inverse distance weighting method to bias-correct the key model-simulated ozone metrics. We find that on a 5-year average basis there are 186,000 (95\% Confidence Interval: 129,000--237,000) respiratory deaths and 125,000 (42,000--204,000) cardiovascular deaths attributable to ozone exposure. Sichuan exhibits the largest per capita respiratory mortality (0.31‰) among all provinces. We find that there are 73,000 (51,000--93,000) premature respiratory deaths in urban areas, accounting for 39\% of total deaths. Between 2013 and 2017 the population-weighted annual average maximum daily 8-h average ozone (AMDA8) and premature respiratory deaths increased by 14\% and 31\%, respectively, at a national level. Changes in precursor emissions explain most of these increases, with differences in meteorology accounting for 21\% and 16\% respectively. Interannual variations in population-weighted ozone and premature respiratory deaths at a provincial level are much larger than those at a national level, particularly in northern, central and eastern China. These findings emphasize that ozone should be an important focus of future air quality policies in China, and tighter controls of precursor emissions are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Spatial epidemiology investigates the patterns and determinants of health outcomes over both space and time. Within this field, Bayesian spatiotemporal models have gained popularity due to their capacity to incorporate spatial and temporal dependencies, uncertainties, and intricate interactions. However, the complexity of modelling and computations associated with Bayesian spatiotemporal models vary across different diseases. Presently, there is a limited comprehensive overview of Bayesian spatiotemporal models and their applications in epidemiology. This article aims to address this gap through a thorough review. The review commences by delving into the historical development of Bayesian spatiotemporal models concerning disease mapping, prediction, and regression analysis. Subsequently, the article compares these models in terms of spatiotemporal data distribution, general spatiotemporal data models, environmental covariates, parameter estimation methods, and model fitting standards. Following this, essential preparatory processes are outlined, encompassing data acquisition, data preprocessing, and available statistical software. The article further categorizes and summarizes the application of Bayesian spatiotemporal models in spatial epidemiology. Lastly, a critical examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these models, along with considerations for their application, is provided. This comprehensive review aims to enhance comprehension of the dynamic spatiotemporal distribution and prediction of epidemics. By facilitating effective disease scrutiny, especially in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the review holds significant academic merit and practical value. It also aims to contribute to the development of improved ecological and epidemiological prevention and control strategies.},

  abstract = {Ozone (O3) is one of the most important trace gases in the troposphere because of its impact on human health, crop yield, climate change, and atmospheric oxidizing capacity. In recent years, China has suffered from deleterious O3 pollution in many regions, especially in eastern China during summer. However, understanding the causes of high O3 pollution episodes is still limited because existing measurements were mainly conducted at the surface level. In this study, we conducted an intensive tethered-balloon measurement at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System in the Yangtze River Delta during a multiday O3 episode in mid-June 2014, with the highest hourly surface O3 record (142 ppbv) at the station in 2014. By integrating available ground-based, remote sensing and aircraft measurement data together with chemical transport modeling and Lagrangian dispersion modeling, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the main source and formation mechanism for two typical days during the multiday O3 episode. On 11 June, agricultural straw burning in the north significantly enhanced O3 concentration (40--50 ppbv) above the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over Nanjing and further influenced the downwind surface O3 in the following days. On 14 June, regional photochemically aged air masses from city clusters in the Yangtze River Delta substantially influenced early morning ground O3 concentrations by vertical mixing from the residual layer and contributed to PBL daytime O3 buildup. This study provides a clear picture of the transport and mixing of O3 and relevant pollutants in the PBL from different sources and highlights the significance of regional emission control in the mitigation of photochemical pollution in eastern China.},

  abstract = {Heatwaves with unprecedented conditions have devastating health impacts. The summer of 2017 saw unusual heat in China and other regions on earth. Although epidemiologic evidence is clear for elevated mortality risks of heatwaves, the economic impacts due to heatwave-associated mortality remain poorly characterized. Hence, this study systematically assessed the mortality and economic impacts of the 2017 exceptional heatwaves in China. We first used the generalized linear mixed-effect model with Poisson distribution to examine the mortality risks of the 2017 heatwaves in 91 Chinese counties. Further, we calculated the excess deaths attributable to heatwaves in 2852 counties. Finally, we evaluated the city- and province-level death-related economic burden of the 2017 heatwaves based on the value of statistical life (VSL). We found that the 2017 exceptional heatwaves had a statistically significant association (relative risk was 1.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.14--1.32) with all-cause mortality across 91 Chinese counties. Nationwide, a total of 16,299 all-cause deaths that occurred in 2017 were attributable to the exceptional heatwaves, resulting in an overall death-related economic loss of 61,304 million RMB as valued by VSL. Given that extraordinary heatwaves are projected to be more frequent under global climate change, our findings could enhance the current understanding of heatwaves' health and economic impacts and add valuable insights in projection studies of estimating the future health burden of heatwaves.},
